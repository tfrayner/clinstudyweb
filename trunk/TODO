Wish List
---------

- Add js to autopopulate compound terms from the database while typing
  ("google suggest").

- Controllers with appropriate add/edit/view/delete methods for the
  following:

  GraftFailure

- TestCalc API wants modifying to include some kind of validation
  call; e.g. BVAS has system-specific "none" fields which imply the
  rest of that system should be clear.

- Figure out how to allow the user to aggregate test results
  themselves (easily, that is. Normally this will be automated).
  Consider maybe encoding how to aggregate tests in the database? Or,
  perhaps better, in a config file somewhere? May need some kind of
  mini-language to cover basic arithmetical operations; starts to
  sound overly complex...

- Add Drugs and PriorTreatments in main patient entry form. This needs
  nesting, which raises all kinds of issues. In particular it seems to
  need a substantial rewrite of HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC :-(

- Support for clinstudy_dump.pl export of single patients/assay_batches.

- SemanticValidator loader class to check CVs and Test names against
  the database prior to ClinStudyML loading?

- Generic ClinStudy::XML::Import PK derivation through introspection
  (i.e. not simply "id" throughout).
