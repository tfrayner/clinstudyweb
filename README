Prerequisite modules; install these in the following order, ideally using CPAN, CPANPLUS or similar:

  Readonly (and Readonly::XS); required by Task::Catalyst but apparently they missed that fact :-(
  DBD::SQLite (needed by blood imports script, others)
  DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader (for development and migration only)
  Task::Catalyst (installs many dependencies)

  Regexp::Copy (another dependency missed, this time for HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC).
  DateTime::Format::Natural (ditto).
  Moose (ditto, this time Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu is the culprit)
  Catalyst::Controller::HTML::FormFu
  HTML::FormFu::Model::DBIC
  Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap
  Config::YAML
  Regexp::Common

  for Raven support:

  Ucam::WebAuth::AA
  Ucam::WebAuth::Ticket

  Note that at the time of writing, installing Task::Catalyst is a
  royal PITA due to various dependencies not being fully documented,
  bugs in DBD::SQLite and so forth. You may need to try running the
  install several times, each time installing a handful more modules,
  for a full installation to succeed.

  Note also that version 0.09 of Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::ACL
  contains a bug which renders it unusable with this application; use
  version 0.08 instead.

Run script/cimr_clinweb_server.pl to start the application.
