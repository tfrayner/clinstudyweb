<h1>ClinStudyWeb</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of the ClinStudyWeb project is to develop a distributable
database system for tracking clinical study data in a disease-agnostic
fashion. The system is designed to integrate clinical data with
high-throughput genomic technologies such as gene expression or
genotyping microarrays.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>Written, tested and maintained as part of a clinical study
investigating both rare and prevalent autoimmune diseases, the
ClinStudyWeb system has demonstrated its adaptability to complex
real-world clinical research environments.</li>

<li>By using a generic database schema ClinStudyWeb provides a flexible semantic
framework within which patient data from many different concurrent
clinical studies may be managed.</li>

<li>Data transfer between multiple clinical sites is facilitated by a
well-defined XML data exchange format.</li>

<li>ClinStudyWeb includes an extensible modular architecture designed
to simplify the acquisition, storage and querying of complex clinical test
results and classification scores.</li>

<li>Easy management of patient data using a secure web interface built
using MVC design principles.</li>

<li>Secure programmatic interface via a built-in REST-based API.</li>

<li>Full integration with the R statistical programming language and the
many data analysis packages provided by the Bioconductor project.</li>

<li>MIAME-supportive export of data in MAGE-TAB format (v1.1), ready
for submission to international data repositories as part of the
publication process.</li>

</ul>
